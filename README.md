IMC Calculator
=============

This application  calculate the user Body Mass Index based on its height and weight.
I created this application just to learn Windows Phone 7 technology.
It helps me to learn the basic stuff.

Live Tile
------------

The most interesting feature on Windows Phone 7 is the Live Tile and I really thinks that application could be way better using Live Tile in a great manner.
That's why I really want to add Live Tile in my application.
It was really interesting to add it on such a simple application. I think that with this the application is really nicer to use than any other one.

Silverlight Toolkit
------------

I use the Silverlight Toolkit to display your BMI and give information. It was really interesting.
Windows Phone is really an interesting platform

Localization
------------
It was really important for me to localize the application with the most language possible.
And especially the ones I like.
That's why I localize the application in Swedish, Norwaygian, Danish, Dutch, German, English, Italian, Spanish and of course French (my native tongue).

But it is approximative in some part of the application

Want to contribute? Great! There are ways to help me.

You can help me lmocalizing the app by translating your native tongue AppResources...resx file.

Installation
-----------

    1. Download the application or just open the resx you want to help translating on Github.
	2. Translate it to a much more correct sentence or word.
	3. Pull it.
	4. Enjoy a refreshing Diet Coke and wait
